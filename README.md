# cpp-template
I always struggle to remember the Makefile content when createing a new project
So I created this super basic "Hello World" cpp template with Makefile 
that can resolve most of the things like libs/includes/packages, etc. that I normally use..

Usage:
------
- Edit your code and adjust Makefile accordingly..
- Just run `make` to build
