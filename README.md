# cpp-template
I always struggle to remember the Makefile content when createing a new project
So I creat a basic "Hello World" cpp template with Makefile that can resolve most
of the things like libs/includes/packages, etc. that I normally use..

- Just run `make` to build
- Edit the Makefile accordingly..
